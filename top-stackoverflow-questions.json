It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <strong><em>there are very many very bad C++ books</em></strong> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Please edit the accepted answer to provide <strong>quality books</strong> and an approximate skill level \u2014 <em>preferably</em> <strong>after</strong> <em>discussing your addition in <a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec\">the C++ chat room</a></em>. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list.  Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review. </p>\n\n<p><sub><em>Note: FAQs and other resources can be found in the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/c%2b%2b/info\">C++ tag info</a> and under <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b-faq\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'c++-faq'\" rel=\"tag\">c++-faq</a>.
